# Pathfinding-Site

You can see the implementation of BFS and DFS using simple JS.<br/>
You can make walls (black) where the person can't visit.<br/>
More algorithms will be implemented in the future(hopefully XD).<br/>
Cilck to create a wall.BFS will give shortest path and DFS will implement it's own search(Not always the shortest path)</br>
May add Diagonal movements feature in the future.<br/>
(Greenish is BFS and Yellowish is DFS,Blue is start, Red is end and Black is Walls)<br/>
